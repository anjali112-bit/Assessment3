-- Frontend Setup --

1. **Cloning the Frontend Repository:**
   Clone the frontend repository containing HTML, CSS, and JS files.

2. **Opening Frontend:**
   Navigate to the cloned directory and open it in your code editor. Then, launch a live server to view the frontend in your browser.

3. **Launching Live Server:**
   Use a live server extension in your code editor or any other tool to launch the frontend application. This will render the HTML, CSS, and JS files in your browser.

-- Backend Setup --

1. **Cloning the Backend Repository:**
   Clone the backend repository built with Spring Boot and MongoDB.

2. **Building the Backend:**
   Navigate to the cloned backend directory and build the project. You can use Maven or any other build tool specified in the project.

3. **Running the Backend:**
   Once built successfully, run the backend project. This will start the Spring Boot application, making the API endpoints available for interaction.

4. **Entering Data into the Database:**
   You can enter data into the MongoDB database either by using the frontend user form or by using Postman. The API endpoints defined in the backend controller handle the data entry process.

With these steps, both the frontend and backend of the application will be up and running, allowing users to interact with the system seamlessly.
